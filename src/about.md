Central Utah Linux/Unix User Group (CULUG) is a technology-focused user group supporting Linux, Unix (i.e. MacOS) or Unix-like technologies.
The group is intended to serve as a casual meeting space for people interested in technology in the Central Utah area.

Although, the group's focus is on Linux and other Unix/Unix-like technologies, _any_ computer science related content is welcomed. In particular, a focus on open source technology is of most interest to the group as it enables any group member to participate in projects they may be interested in.

The group was created by [Spencer Heywood](https://github.com/heywoodlh) in an effort to provide a technology-focused group for interested parties in the rural Central Utah area.
