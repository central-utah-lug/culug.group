Thank you for visiting and welcome to the Central Utah Linux/Unix User Group's website! 

Central Utah Linux/Unix User Group (CULUG) is a technology-focused user group supporting Linux, Unix (i.e. MacOS) or Unix-like technologies.
The group is intended to serve as a casual meeting space for people interested in technology in the Central Utah area.

TBD: stay tuned for the announcement on when and where we will be meeting as a group.
