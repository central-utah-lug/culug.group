## Discord updates

Notable changes have been introduced to our Discord instance to increase accessibility:
1. Weekly meetings will be automatically transcribed via Scripty and saved to `#meeting-notes` channel
2. Weekly meetings will be recorded with Craig and will be accessible with the `/recordings` subcommand
3. Messages in meeting-notes will be publicly visible via Linen: <https://www.linen.dev/s/central-utah-lug/c/meeting-notes>
   a. Note: usernames are set to be anonymous

## Canceling meetup.com membership

Due to how expensive meetup.com is, we're canceling the subscription behind the group on meetup.com and will no longer be updating the page. Please feel free to join Discord if you want to stay up-to-date on announcements: <https://discord.gg/KEBCqdANz4>
